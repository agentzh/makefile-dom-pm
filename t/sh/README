The tests hosted in this directory are for testing ../../script/sh
To harness this tester against another shell, just set the
TEST_SHELL_PATH environment to the (full) path of the shell or simply
the name of the shell if the shell is in PATH. For example:

	set TEST_SHELL_PATH=/bin/sh
	set TEST_SHELL_PATH=bash
